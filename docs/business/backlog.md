---

## Epic: Sports Data

### 6a. Admin Tournament Management (MVP) ✅

**As an** admin, **I want to** manage teams, tournaments, and game data via an admin UI **so that** tournament data can be entered and corrected manually, serving as both a primary data entry method for testing and a fallback/override for automated sync.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- All pool members can view the full member list (name, role)
- Pool leaders can change a member's role between "member" and "leader"
- Pool leaders can remove any member (including other leaders and the original pool creator)
- Removing a member hard-deletes all of their bracket entries from the pool
- Removal requires a confirmation dialog
- Regular members cannot edit roles or remove other members
- Any member (including leaders) can leave a pool voluntarily
  - Leaving hard-deletes all of the member's bracket entries from the pool
  - Members are warned that their brackets will be removed before confirming
  - A leader cannot leave if they are the last leader in the pool — they must promote another member to leader first
  - If a member is the only person in the pool, leaving deletes the pool entirely
- Only pool leaders see role edit and remove controls in the UI

---

## Epic: Bracket Creation

### 9. Create Bracket Entry (MVP) ✅

**As a** pool member, **I want to** create a bracket entry with my tournament picks **so that** I can compete in the pool.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User can create a new bracket entry if they haven't hit the pool's max bracket limit

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User sees a list of their bracket entries in the pool detail page with current points and potential remaining points (after tournament starts)
- User can click into an individual bracket for detail
- Pool standings page shows all brackets including the user's own

### 12. View Other Members' Brackets (MVP) ✅

**As a** pool member, **I want to** view other members' brackets **so that** I can see how my competition is doing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User can view any other member's bracket within a shared pool (read-only)
- Same summary info shown: bracket name, current points, potential remaining points
- Accessible via pool standings page links

### 13. View Pool Standings (MVP) ✅

**As a** pool member, **I want to** see the pool standings **so that** I know where I rank.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Standings show all brackets in the pool ordered by: points (desc), then potential points (desc), then tiebreaker accuracy, then alphabetical (asc)
- Each row shows: rank, bracket name, owner (with avatar), champion pick (team logo), current points, potential remaining points
- User can click into any bracket for detail

### 14. View Individual Bracket Detail (MVP) ✅

---

## Epic: Scoring & Standings

### 15. Live Bracket Scoring & Standings (MVP) ✅

**As a** pool member, **I want** bracket standings to update automatically as game results are recorded **so that** I can track how I and others are performing in real time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] When game results are synced from ESPN, all bracket entries have their scores recalculated automatically
- [x] When an admin manually edits a game result, standings are NOT auto-recalculated — the admin uses the separate "Sync Standings" button to trigger recalculation on demand (intentional: allows batch manual edits without repeated recalculation)
- [x] Each pick is scored based on the pool's round-based scoring settings
- [x] Pool standings reflect current scores and are viewable by all pool members
- [x] Potential remaining points are calculated for each bracket entry (max points still achievable)
- [x] Standings are ordered by: points (desc), potential points (desc), tiebreaker accuracy, then alphabetical
- [x] Architecture decision: admin-triggered batch sync stores `totalPoints` and `potentialPoints` on `bracketEntry` table for fast reads

**Additional work completed in this PR:**

- Bracket view shows correct/incorrect pick indicators (green/red) with points earned per pick
- Bracket view header shows live "Points: X | Potential: Y" summary
- Success/failure CSS variables added to design system
- Create bracket and create invite locked after tournament starts (backend + UI)
- Mobile navigation affordance on bracket list items

---

## Epic: Tournament Lock

### 46. Bracket Lock at Round of 64 Start (MVP) ✅

**As a** user, **I want** all bracket creation, editing, pool management, and invite functionality to lock when the Round of 64 begins **so that** the competition is fair and mirrors how real bracket challenges work.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Lock deadline stored on tournament:** Add a `bracketLockTime` field to the tournament table, representing the scheduled start time of the first Round of 64 game
  - This time is auto-calculated from game schedule data (earliest R64 game `startTime`) during ESPN sync
  - Admin can manually override the lock time via the admin UI
- **Global app-wide lock:** Once the current time passes `bracketLockTime`, the following actions are blocked (backend enforcement + UI indicators):
  - Creating or editing bracket entries (picks and tiebreaker)
  - Submitting or unsubmitting brackets
  - Deleting brackets
  - Auto-filling or clearing bracket picks
  - Creating pools or editing pool settings (name, scoring, max brackets, max participants)
  - Creating invite links or sending in-app invites
  - Joining pools (via invite link or public search)
- **First Four is NOT locked:** Users can still create/edit brackets while First Four games are in progress — the lock only applies at the R64 scheduled start time
- **Draft brackets at lock time:** Unsubmitted (draft) brackets remain visible but are permanently locked as incomplete — they cannot earn points or appear in standings. Users must submit before the deadline for their bracket to be eligible
- **Countdown timer UI:** Display a countdown to the lock deadline on bracket creation/editing pages and pool detail pages so users know when the deadline is
  - Shows days, hours, minutes remaining
  - After lock, displays "Brackets are locked" instead of countdown
- **Admin override:** Admin can manually adjust the `bracketLockTime` via the admin tournament UI (e.g., if the tournament start is delayed)
- **Replace existing lock logic:** The current `hasTournamentStarted()` function (which checks if any game has moved off "scheduled" status) is replaced with a time-based check against `bracketLockTime`

## Epic: Pre-Tournament Setup

### 34. Configure ESPN Sync Cron Jobs (MVP) ✅ — Epic: Pre-Tournament Setup

**As the** product owner, **I want to** set up the cron jobs on cron-job.org for ESPN data sync **so that** tournament data syncs automatically once games begin.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Cron jobs configured on cron-job.org to hit the ESPN sync endpoint(s) on an appropriate schedule
- Sync frequency is suitable for live tournament updates (e.g., every few minutes during game days)
- Verify sync works end-to-end in production before the tournament starts

### 39. Validate Cron Sync Performance (MVP) ✅ — Epic: Pre-Tournament Setup

**As the** product owner, **I want to** validate that the ESPN sync cron job completes well within a 30-second timeout **so that** syncs don't fail or get killed mid-transaction in production.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Audit the sync endpoint (`/api/sync-espn`)** for total execution time under realistic conditions:
  - Scoreboard fetch from ESPN API (single date vs. multi-date scenarios)
  - DB transaction: team upserts, game matching/updates, winner advancement
  - Post-sync standings recalculation across all pools
- **Measure or estimate wall-clock time** for each phase of the sync under peak load (e.g., R64 day with 16 games in progress, multiple pools with many bracket entries)
- **Address the multi-date fetch bottleneck**: the current 500ms delay between date fetches in `espn-adapter.ts` means a 2-day R64 window adds 500ms+ overhead — verify this is acceptable or optimize
- **Verify standings recalc scales**: `syncStandingsForTournament()` runs after every sync — confirm it completes quickly with realistic pool/bracket counts
- **Confirm team stats sync is NOT called by the cron endpoint** (it runs separately via admin UI and takes ~20-30s on its own for 68 teams — must never be bundled into the cron)
- **Add logging or timing instrumentation** to the sync endpoint so execution time can be monitored in production (e.g., log total duration and phase durations)
- **Document any optimizations made** and the expected sync duration under various tournament phases
- **Set Vercel function `maxDuration`** on the sync route if needed to ensure adequate timeout (Vercel Pro allows up to 300s, but target < 30s)

### 32. Update External Services Branding (MVP) ✅ — Epic: Branding

**As the** product owner, **I want to** update the app name, icons, and metadata across all external services **so that** the Bracketsball brand is consistent everywhere.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Google Cloud Console: Update OAuth consent screen app name to "Bracketsball", upload app icon (`icon-512.png`)
- Discord Developer Portal: Update application name to "Bracketsball", upload app icon (`icon-512.png`)
- Vercel: Update project name/display name to "Bracketsball"
- GitHub: Update repository description to reflect new name
- Neon: Update project name/description if applicable
- cron-job.org: Update job names/descriptions to reflect new name
- Verify OAuth consent screens show correct name and icon for both Google and Discord flows

## Non-MVP Stories (Prioritized)

Stories below are ordered by priority. Completed stories are grouped at the end.

---

### 47. Filter Pool Data by Active Tournament (Non-MVP) ✅ — Epic: Multi-Season Support

**As a** pool member, **I want** my pool's bracket list and related data to only show entries for the current active tournament **so that** I don't see stale brackets from previous tournaments when a new season starts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Bracket list on pool detail page** filters bracket entries by the active tournament — entries from previous tournaments are not shown
- **Bracket count checks** (e.g., "you have X of Y allowed brackets") only count entries for the active tournament, so users can create new brackets for the new tournament even if they had entries in previous ones
- **All pool-scoped bracket queries** that currently filter by `poolId` alone are audited and updated to also filter by `tournamentId` where appropriate (e.g., `getBracketEntriesByPoolAndUser`)
- **Standings already work correctly** — `getPoolStandings()` already filters by both `poolId` and `tournamentId`, so no change needed there
- **No data deletion** — previous tournament bracket entries remain in the database; they are simply not displayed in the current tournament view
- **Future-compatible** — the approach should not preclude adding historical tournament views to pools later (e.g., a "Past Seasons" tab)

### 48. Direct Invite Role Selection (Non-MVP) ✅ — Epic: Pool Members

**As a** pool leader, **I want to** specify the role (member or leader) when sending a direct user invite **so that** I can invite someone directly as a leader without having to change their role after they join.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- When sending a direct user invite, the leader can choose whether the invitee will join as "member" (default) or "leader"
- The selected role is stored on the invite and used when the invite is accepted
- The sent invites list shows the assigned role for each invite
- The invite notification shown to the recipient indicates when they are being invited as a leader
- Existing invites default to "member" role (backward compatible)

### 44. Stats-Based Bracket Generation (Non-MVP) ✅ — Epic: Auto-Fill Bracket

**As a** pool member, **I want to** generate bracket picks based on team stats with customizable category weights **so that** I can create data-driven brackets tailored to my strategy preferences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Entry point — Auto-fill "Custom" option:**
  - A 4th option, "Custom", is added to the existing auto-fill dropdown (alongside Chalk, Weighted Random, Random)
  - Selecting "Custom" opens a dedicated modal/dialog for configuring stats-based generation
- **Stat categories available for weighting:**
  - PPG, Opponent PPG, FG%, 3PT%, FT%, Rebounds per Game, Assists per Game, Steals per Game, Blocks per Game, Turnovers per Game
  - For Opponent PPG and Turnovers per Game, lower values are treated as better (inverted)
- **Presets:**
  - User can select from predefined presets that auto-populate weights:
    - **Offense-Heavy**: PPG, FG%, 3PT%, FT% weighted high
    - **Defense-Heavy**: Opponent PPG (inverted), Steals, Blocks, Turnovers (inverted) weighted high
    - **Balanced**: even weight across all stat categories
    - **Rebounding & Hustle**: Rebounds, Steals, Blocks weighted high
  - Selecting a preset populates the custom weight controls, which the user can further adjust
- **Custom weights:**
  - User can manually adjust the weight for each stat category
  - UI should make it intuitive to see which stats are emphasized (implementation detail left to developer discretion — e.g., sliders, numeric inputs, or tiered dropdowns)
- **Chaos level (upset probability):**
  - User selects a chaos level that controls how likely upsets are: **Low**, **Medium**, **High**
  - Low: stats-favored team wins almost always; High: significant randomness, more upsets
  - This replaces a simple deterministic/probabilistic toggle — all levels introduce some probability, but Low is near-deterministic
- **Generation behavior:**
  - Populates all remaining unpicked games in the bracket (same as existing auto-fill)
  - Games are resolved in round order so earlier-round picks feed into later rounds
  - User can modify any generated picks before submitting
  - Available during bracket creation and editing (before tournament lock)
- **Missing stats handling:**
  - If a stat category has no data for one or both teams in a matchup, that category is skipped and remaining categories determine the pick
  - If no stat data is available for either team, falls back to seed-based logic
- **Single-game pick from team comparison:**
  - When viewing the team comparison dialog for a specific matchup in the bracket builder, a "Pick by Stats" button is available
  - Clicking it uses the stats-based logic (with the user's last-used preset/custom config and chaos level) to auto-pick the winner for that single game
  - If no prior config has been set, defaults to Balanced preset with Low chaos

### 49. Splash Page Differentiation & Redesign (Non-MVP) ✅ — Epic: Branding

**As a** visitor, **I want** the splash page to clearly communicate what makes Bracketsball different from ESPN, Yahoo, and CBS bracket apps **so that** I understand why I should use it over the competition.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Hero section communicates indie/friend-group positioning (not generic "bracket app" messaging)
- Comparison section highlights key differentiators vs. big bracket apps (multiple brackets per pool, custom scoring, stats-based generation, no ads)
- Stats-based bracket generation feature is prominently showcased with a visual preview of the weight/chaos controls
- Feature cards highlight unique capabilities (multiple brackets, custom scoring, potential points tracking, built for groups)
- Trust/indie section communicates that Bracketsball is fan-built, free, ad-free, and open source
- How It Works section is retained and tightened
- Final CTA with urgency messaging is retained
- Accessibility: screen reader text on comparison icons, decorative SVG has aria-hidden
- Page builds and passes lint with zero errors

### 25. Auto-Fill Bracket Picks (Non-MVP) — Epic: Auto-Fill Bracket

**As a** pool member, **I want to** auto-fill my bracket with generated picks **so that** I can quickly create an entry without manually picking every game.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User can choose from two auto-fill strategies:
  - **Chalk (Higher Seed Always)**: the higher-seeded team always wins
  - **Weighted Random**: winners are randomly selected, weighted toward the higher seed based on the seed differential
- Auto-fill populates all remaining unpicked games in the bracket
- User can modify any auto-filled picks before submitting
- Auto-fill is available during bracket creation and editing (before tournament lock)

### 41. Unused Code Enforcement & Cleanup (Non-MVP) ✅ — Epic: Tech Debt

**As a** developer, **I want** a lint rule that catches unused exports and dead code, plus a one-time audit to remove existing unused code, **so that** the codebase stays lean and maintainable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Lint enforcement:**
  - Add a tool (e.g., `knip` or `ts-prune`) to detect unused exports, unused files, and dead code
  - Integrate into the CI/lint pipeline so unused code is caught before merge
  - Document the chosen tool and configuration in `docs/technical/standards.md`
- **One-time audit:**
  - Run the tool across the entire codebase and remove all confirmed unused exports and dead code (e.g., `getPublicPoolById` and similar)
  - Verify removal doesn't break builds or tests
- **Ongoing standard:**
  - Add a standard to `docs/technical/standards.md` that exported functions/types must have at least one consumer — no speculative exports

### 42. Codebase Standards Audit (Non-MVP) ✅ — Epic: Tech Debt

**As a** developer, **I want** an audit of the codebase against `docs/technical/standards.md` **so that** existing code conforms to our documented conventions and any gaps are fixed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Audit every standard in `docs/technical/standards.md` against the current codebase, including but not limited to:
  - **Project structure**: files colocated correctly, shared components in `components/`, one component per file
  - **Naming conventions**: files/folders kebab-case, components PascalCase, functions camelCase, constants UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, DB tables/columns snake_case
  - **TypeScript**: no unnecessary `any`, correct use of `interface` vs `type`, `@/*` path alias used consistently, `satisfies` where appropriate
  - **React & Next.js**: Server Components by default, no `useEffect` for data fetching, `next/image` and `next/link` used, Server Actions for mutations
  - **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod, schemas in `lib/validators/`
  - **UI & Styling**: no raw color classes (only CSS variable-based), no arbitrary color values, mobile-first responsive design, no inline `style` props
  - **Database**: queries in `lib/db/queries/` (no inline SQL), transactions for multi-step writes, parameterized queries
  - **API Routes & Server Actions**: Zod validation at boundaries, thin actions calling shared query functions, cron auth via shared secret
  - **Error handling**: `error.tsx` boundaries, `notFound()` usage, no internal error details leaked to client
  - **Linting & formatting**: zero errors from `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build`
- Document all violations found
- Fix all violations
- Verify fixes pass `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, and don't break existing functionality

### 21. Transaction Audit (Non-MVP) ✅ — Epic: Tech Debt

**As a** developer, **I want to** audit all existing query functions and server actions for missing transactions **so that** data integrity is guaranteed across the app.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Audit all files in `lib/db/queries/` for functions that perform multiple DB writes without a transaction
- Audit all server actions for action functions that call multiple write query functions without wrapping in a transaction
- All query functions that perform multiple writes use `db.transaction()`
- All server actions that call multiple write functions accept/pass a `DbClient` parameter and wrap writes in a single transaction
- Add `DbClient` optional parameter to query functions that need to participate in action-level transactions
- Standardize the `client: DbClient = db` pattern across all query functions — establish a consistent convention for when and how query functions accept a transaction client, including handling the dual-use case (standalone with own transaction vs. participating in a caller's transaction) without ad-hoc `client === db` checks
- Document the chosen pattern in `docs/technical/standards.md` so future query functions follow the same approach
- Document any functions that were fixed

### 16. Manage Bracket Scoring Settings (Non-MVP) ✅ — Epic: Pool Settings

**As a** pool leader, **I want to** customize scoring per round **so that** I can tailor the pool's competitiveness.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Points per round can be customized individually
- Only pool leaders can edit scoring
- Changes are locked once tournament games begin

### 33. Team & Game Info in Bracket Builder (Non-MVP) — Epic: Bracket UX Enhancements

**As a** pool member filling out my bracket, **I want to** see supplemental information about each team and game **so that** I can make more informed picks — especially for teams I'm unfamiliar with.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Investigation phase:** Research how to source supplemental team data (records, stats, strength ratings, short team descriptions). Evaluate options including:
  - ESPN API (existing integration) — check if team records (overall and conference), stats, rankings, or team descriptions are available
  - Other public/free sports data APIs (e.g., NCAA, kenpom-style ratings)
  - Static/manually curated data as a fallback
- Document findings and chosen approach before implementation begins
- **Implementation — Game Details Button (pending investigation):**
  - Each game matchup in the bracket builder has a small "details" button (e.g., info icon)
  - Clicking/tapping opens a popover or modal with:
    - Game venue/location
    - Team records: overall (W-L) and conference (W-L) for each team
    - Strengths, weaknesses, or other scouting-style notes per team (content depends on data source availability)
    - Any other useful context (e.g., conference name, national ranking)
  - Details button should be unobtrusive — doesn't clutter the pick UI
  - Works on both desktop and mobile
- **Implementation — Game Date/Time in Bracket View:**
  - Enrich the bracket view (read-only bracket detail, not just the builder) to display the scheduled date and time for each game
  - Date/time should be shown inline on each game card where space allows
  - Games that have already been played can show the date played
- **Data requirements:**
  - Data is sourced automatically where possible (synced or fetched), with admin override capability
  - New team fields (records, descriptions) stored in the DB and kept in sync

### 18. Bracket Pool Public/Private Toggle (Non-MVP) ✅ — Epic: Public Pools

**As a** pool leader, **I want to** make my pool public or private **so that** I can control who can discover and join it.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Pool can be toggled between public and private
- Private pools are invite-only
- Public pools appear in search results
- Toggle available at creation and in settings

### 20. Public Pool Search (Non-MVP) ✅ — Epic: Public Pools

**As a** user, **I want to** search for public pools **so that** I can find and join open competitions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User can search public pools by name
- User can filter by brackets-per-entry range and pool size range
- Only pools with available capacity are shown
- User can join directly from search results

### 43. Improved Delete Confirmations (Non-MVP) ✅ — Epic: UX

**As a** user, **I want** delete confirmations to be appropriately protective **so that** I don't accidentally delete important data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Pool deletion:** Confirmation dialog requires the user to type the pool name before the delete button is enabled
- **Account deletion:** Confirmation uses a simple popup modal with a confirm/cancel button (no typing required)
- Both confirmations clearly warn the user about what will be permanently removed
- Delete button remains disabled until the confirmation condition is met (pool name typed for pools, button click for account)

### 17. In-App User Invites (Non-MVP) — Epic: Pool Members

**As a** pool member, **I want to** invite existing users by searching for them **so that** I don't need to share a link externally.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User can search for other users by username
- Selected users receive an in-app invite notification
- Invited users can accept or decline

### 45. Dark/Light Mode Team Icons (Non-MVP) ✅ — Epic: Bracket UX Enhancements

**As a** user, **I want** team logos to display appropriately for my current theme (light or dark mode) **so that** logos remain clear and visually correct regardless of my theme preference.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Investigation phase:** Check ESPN API responses for dark-mode logo variants (ESPN typically provides both light and dark logo URLs per team) and document findings
- **Data model update:** If ESPN provides dark-mode logos, add a `darkLogoUrl` (or equivalent) field to the team table and sync it from ESPN
- **ESPN sync update:** Update the ESPN sync adapter to pull and store the dark-mode logo URL alongside the existing logo URL
- **Frontend display:** Update all team logo rendering across the app to use the appropriate logo based on the user's current theme (light/dark mode):
  - Bracket builder (matchup cards, team comparison dialog)
  - Bracket viewer (read-only bracket detail)
